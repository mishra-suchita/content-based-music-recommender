# content-based-music-recommender
two types of recommender systems are there
i) content based and
ii) collaborative
In this project we are working on content based music recommender.
It aims to recommend the music similar to what the user likes, based on their previous feedbacks and playlist.
The approach is to use keyword matching. The idea is to extract the keyword present in the song description liked by user and search for the keyword in other song description and find the similarities. Based on that ,songs are recommended.
Since we are dealing with text ,will use term frequency-inverse document frequency(Tf-Idf).
